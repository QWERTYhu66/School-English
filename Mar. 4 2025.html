        <h2>Mar. 4, 2025 - The 57 Bus</h2>
        <h2>Final Book Reflection</h2>
        <p>The 57 Bus changes the world by showing how one moment can shape lives and spark important conversations about justice, identity, and empathy. It makes readers think deeply about forgiveness and the impact of our actions. However, books like The Hate U Give and To Kill a Mockingbird might be better choices because they focus more on racial injustice, a larger and ongoing issue that affects millions. While The 57 Bus tells a powerful real-life story, the other books address broader social struggles that have shaped history and continue to influence the world today.</p>
        <h2>Post-it Notes Reflection</h2>
        <p>What I found interesting about others' post-it notes is that most of them talk about connections, for example, racism and wage gaps. Although no one mentioned any SDGs or UDHRs.

        <h2>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</h2>
