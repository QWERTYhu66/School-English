        <h3>Review overview</h3>
            <p>This review praises the book for its balanced portrayal of both Sasha and Richard. The reviewer appreciates how Slater doesn't paint Richard as simply a villain but instead explores the larger issues of the justice system, prejudice, and poverty. The book encourages readers to consider the root causes of crime rather than just focusing on punishment.</p>
        <h3>Two quotes that stood out</h3>
            <p>"The great thing about this book was that it didn't make things black and white, and it showed compassion for both people."</p>
            <p>"Slater unpacked the flawed justice system, homophobia and prejudice, and the negative cycle of poverty and crime."</p>
        <h3>My opinion on this review</h3>
            <p>I agree with this review because the book does an excellent job of showing both sides of the story. It makes readers think about justice and whether people, especially teenagers, should be judged only by their worst mistakes.</p>
